# shapes
A lightweight header-only planar geometry library for Modern C++
 
## Examples

Building a point from GeoJSON:

```cpp
auto p = Point::from_json("{\"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]}");
std::cout << p.x << " " << p.y << " " << p.z << std::endl;
std::cout << p.to_json() std::endl; 
```

Building geometry from WKT:

```cpp
auto point = Geometry::from_wkt("POINT (30 10)");
auto linestring = Geometry::from_wkt("LINESTRING (30 10, 10 30, 40 40)");
```

Iterating a `MultiPoint` is as simple as:

```cpp
MultiPoint points({{0, 0, 1}, {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 7, 7}});
for(const auto& point: points)
{
    std::cout << point.x << " " << point.y << " " << point.z << std::endl;
} 
```
