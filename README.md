A lightweight header-only planar geometry library for Modern C++

- Inspired by python [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/) 
- Complaint with OGC [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features)

## Installation

`shapes` ships as a header-only library:

```cpp
#include <simo/shapes.hpp>

using namespace simo::shapes;
```

## Examples

Building a point from GeoJSON:

```cpp
auto p = Point::from_json("{\"type\": \"Point\", \"coordinates\": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]}");
std::cout << p.x << " " << p.y << " " << p.z << std::endl;
std::cout << p.to_json() std::endl; 
```

Iterating a `MultiPoint` is as simple as:

```cpp
MultiPoint points({{0, 0, 1}, {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 7, 7}});
for(const auto& point: points)
{
    std::cout << point.x << " " << point.y << " " << point.z << std::endl;
} 
```
