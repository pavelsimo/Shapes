A lightweight header-only planar geometry library for Modern C++

- Inspired by python [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)
- Based on OGC [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features)

## Installation

`shapes` ships as a header-only library:

```cpp
#include <simo/shapes.hpp>

using namespace simo::shapes;
```

## Examples

Building a `Point` from GeoJSON:

```cpp
auto p = Point::from_json(R"({"type": "Point", "coordinates": [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]})");
std::cout << p.x << " " << p.y << " " << p.z << std::endl;
```

GeoJSON representation of the `Point`:

```cpp
auto p = Point{1, 2, 3};
p.precision = 1;
std::cout << p.json() << std::endl;
```

```json
{"coordinates":[1.0,2.0,3.0],"type":"Point"}
``` 

Iterating a `MultiPoint` is as simple as:

```cpp
auto points = MultiPoint{{0, 0, 1}, {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 7, 7}};
for(const auto& point: points)
{
    std::cout << point.x << " " << point.y << " " << point.z << std::endl;
} 
```

WKT representation of a `MultiPoint`:

```cpp
auto points = MultiPoint{{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}};
points.precision  = 1;
std::cout << points.wkt() << std::endl;
```

```text
MULTIPOINTZ((1.0 2.0 3.0),(4.0 5.0 6.0))
```

Building a `MultiLineString`

```cpp
auto ml = MultiLineString{
    {{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}, {7.0, 8.0, 9.0}},
    {{11.0, 12.0, 13.0}, {13.0, 14.0, 15.0}, {16.0, 17.0, 18.0}}
};
```
