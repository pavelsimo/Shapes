A lightweight header-only geometry library for Modern C++

- Inspired by python [shapely](https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)
- Based on OGC [Simple Features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Features)

## Installation

`shapes` ships as a header-only library:

```cpp
#include <simo/shapes.hpp>

using namespace simo::shapes;
```

## Examples

Building a `Point` from GeoJSON:

```cpp
auto p = Point::from_json(R"({"type": "Point", "coordinates": [1.0, 2.0]})");
std::cout << p.x << " " << p.y << " " << '\n';
```

GeoJSON representation of a 3d `Point`:

```cpp
auto p = PointZ{1, 2, 3};
std::cout << p.json() << '\n';
```

```json
{"coordinates":[1.0,2.0,3.0],"type":"Point"}
``` 

Iterating a `MultiPoint` is as simple as:

```cpp
auto mp = MultiPoint{{0, 0}, {1, 2}, {4, 5}, {7, 7}};
for(const auto& p: mp)
{
    std::cout << p.x << " " << p.y << '\n';
} 
```

WKT representation of a `MultiPoint`:

```cpp
auto mp = MultiPointZ{{1.0, 2.0, 3.0}, {4.0, 5.0, 6.0}};
std::cout << mp.wkt() << '\n';
```

```text
MULTIPOINTZ((1.0 2.0 3.0),(4.0 5.0 6.0))
```

Creating a `LineString` from a google polyline:

```cpp
std::string polyline = "_p~iF~ps|U_ulLnnqC_mqNvxq`@";
auto ls = LineString::from_polyline(polyline);
std::cout << points.wkt() << '\n';
```

```text
LINESTRING(-120.2 38.5,-120.95 40.7,-126.453 43.252)
```

Google Polyline representation of a `LineString`:

```cpp
auto ls = LineString{{-120.2, 38.5}, {-120.95, 40.7}, {-126.453, 43.252}};
std::cout << ls.polyline() << '\n';
```

```text
_p~iF~ps|U_ulLnnqC_mqNvxq`@
```

Building a `MultiLineString`:

```cpp
auto ml = MultiLineString{
    {{1.0, 2.0}, {4.0, 5.0}, {7.0, 8.0}},
    {{11.0, 12.0}, {13.0, 14.0}, {16.0, 17.0}}
};
```
